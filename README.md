# BASIC_JS_Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Practice Projects repository! 

## Learnings

This repo contains a collection of basic JavaScript projects that I have worked on. Each project has been an exciting journey and a valuable learning experience, helping me to enhance my understanding of JavaScript concepts and improve my logic-building skills.

Description: 
I learned how to implement a basic calculator using object-oriented programming principles, including defining a class with methods for different operations (clear, delete, append number, choose operation, compute, and update display). I referred to Web Dev Simplified's video for this project; his approach to writing the code was incredibly insightful and easy to follow.

### 4. Countdown
